# Mood-Music-AI-Emotion-Based-Music-Recommendation-System-
A Deep Learning powered web application that detects human emotions through facial expressions and recommends music playlists based on mood.

This project uses PyTorch (ResNet18) for emotion classification (Happy, Neutral, Sad), OpenCV Haar Cascade for face detection, Flask for the backend, JavaScript for webcam capture, and Matplotlib Analytics to visualize the user’s emotional patterns.
